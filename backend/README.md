# bookdirectory
Hello! 
This is a Book Directory made using Nodejs in the backend and express framework. 
A user has to register themselves so that they can login.
After loggin in, if the user has admin access (which can only be given by the creator from database), they can create, update and delete a book entry.
If the user is a general user (not having admin access), they can only read already present books in their account.
